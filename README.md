# Module Template

A template for a repository that contains a Python module.

## Overview

As well as the template structure, this repository contains some notes, resources, and standards for developing and structuring Python modules.

This template assumes that
[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
is being used for documentation.

#### Other Resources

The following are other available resources for developing a Python module:
- The [shablona template](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) is a nice template for small scientific Python modules

## Repository Structure

The folders in this template are organized as follows:
- `doc`: configuration and content files for making the documentation website
- `modcode`: the source code of the module (renamed to reflect the module name)
- `examples` and/or `tutorials`: examples and tutorials for using the module

Individual files have notes within them detailing what they are for.

## README Outline

The repository should include a descriptive README in the base folder.

Suggested sections in the README are as follows:

#### Overview

_A brief description of the project._

_This can / should include a list of the sub-modules._

#### Documentation

_Links to and brief descriptions of the available documentation._

_This can / should include a list of the available pages on the documentation website._

#### Dependencies

_Notes on the requirements for installing and using this module._

_This should include programming language, major version required, and a list of dependencies._

#### Installation

_Notes and instructions on installing the module._

#### Reference

_Links to the reference for the project, such as a preprint or paper._

#### Contribute

_Notes on how to interact with and potentially contribute to the project._

_This section should link to the `CONTRIBUTING` page, and note the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`._
