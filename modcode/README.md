# Module Code

Notes on writing module code.

## Documentating Code

numpydoc

    The numpydoc-standard is a docstring standard, for how to write docstrings.
    The numpydoc package is a sphinx extension to use numpydoc-standard formatted docstrings with sphinx.

doctest

    Technically, a standard library module to test examples written into docstrings.
    I think of it as "doctest format", so that docstring examples can be run.
    Format is basically to use ">>> " before code.
